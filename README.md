LearningPython
==============

Projects I completed to learn python
I am doing the Euler Project to help teach myself python.
See https://projecteuler.net/ for the problems.

1)Sum of 3's or 5's
I completed this solution using lists to test my understanding of adding / deleting values from a list.  There are much simpler solutions to this problem than using a list and storing the data.

2)Fib sequence
I completed this solution using recursion simple solution just adding all of the values to a list and sorting it.  (we can sort it because we know the values gradually get larger thus placing them in the right order ;))
